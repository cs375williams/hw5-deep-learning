# Homework 5: Deep Learning for NLP  

The goals of this assignment are to understand why deep learning can be beneficial for NLP classification tasks, implement simple computation graphs by hand, and implement and train a deep averaging network. 

# Getting started 

To obtain the starter code for this assignment (this repo) on your local machine, follow the same steps as [HW0](https://github.com/cs375williams/hw0-preliminaries). To recap, 

1. Open a terminal. 

2. Clone this repository into a folder of your choice via
	```
	git clone https://github.com/cs375williams/hw5-deep-learning.git
	```

3. Enter the project directory and activate your `cs375` conda environment (which you should have set-up in `HW0`): 
	```
	cd hw5-deep-learning
	conda activate cs375
	```

	You should now see `(cs375)` in front of your shell prompt.  

	You'll need to activate the conda environment every time you open a new terminal and re-start your notebook server. 

4. Start up your jupyter notebook server by typing in the terminal 
	```
	jupyter notebook 
	```

	A window should open automatically in your default browser. If it didn't, the terminal output should contain a URL you can use to open the notebook in a browser of your choice.


5. When you are ready to start the assignment click on `hw5.ipynb` from the Jupyter notebook file explore window that opens. Edit the notebook and craft your solutions to the assignment. 

# Submitting your work 

1. Run the final cell of `hw5.ipynb`. This should generate a zip file called `submission.zip`.

2. Upload `submission.zip` as your solution to the `Homework 5: Deep Learning for NLP` assignment in [CS 375's Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/506455).
